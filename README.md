# Project-One

Tic Tac Toe using native Javascript

The objective of the project is to create a tic tac toe game that showcases our knowledge of manipulating the DOM using native Javascript.
Using knowledge of variables, functions, if and else statements to react to user interactions. 

Each student used basic CSS properties to create their own designs. 

Still a working progress. 
Need to refine code. 
Add player tally and continue to jazz it up a bit. 

Games are then uploaded via GitHub for the public.
